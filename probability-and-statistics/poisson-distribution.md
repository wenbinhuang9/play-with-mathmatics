## What is poisson distribution ? 

Posisson distribution comes from binominal distribution.  When n is large, and p is small, we can use poisson distribution to approximate the binominal distribution. 

So when n is going to infinitive,  we can get the poisson distribution formula, P(x) = e^-l(l^x/x!), where l is lambda, which equals to np.

## How we estimate the lambda

Usually, lambda means  the mean events occuring in a unite time or space.
