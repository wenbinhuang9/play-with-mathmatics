## How I know a population is binomial distribution
We can infer by sampleing from population, and then draw distribution

Get n sample from population each time, compute the random variable, and sample for 100, 1000, or 10000 times,
then draw the distribution graph.

If the distribution is very simarlar to binomial distribution, we can infer that it is a binomial distribution. 


## If we know a poplulation is a binomial distribution, how we get the propability of yes outcome.
We can infer the propability of yes outcome from sample 

According to the Law of Large Numbers, when N-> the positive infinity, when probablity converges to population propability of yes outcome. 

So we can get the probability from the sample, we can infer by the large sample. 

If we compute the probability from the sample, how we confident about the probability? Could we use confidence intervals here?  Sure, as mean = np, and n is fixed , so we can get the confidence interval from a smaple. 

Let A be a random variable of the probability of yes outcome from a sample, we can get the distribution of A by sample, so we may infer the probability from this way.
