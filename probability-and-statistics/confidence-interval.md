## What is confidence interval

We can estimate a mean value from a sample, but sometime we want to estimate the interval of mean value. So what is th e mothed for it?  Confidence interval is used to solve the problemd.

## Confidence interval with big smaple size.

If the sample size, the mean value is normal distribution, given the 95 confidence, we can estimate the interval   m - z * sd, m + z * sd, where m is the mean value, z is the z-score of binominal distribution, where sd should be the population standard deviation, but we can infer from the sample standard deviation. 

## Confidence with small sample size

When sample size is big enough, we can use central limit theorem. But when the sample is small, we can't use it. So what's the method? 

But actually, we can use t distributon. 

How the t distribution is found, what is the logic of t distribution.
