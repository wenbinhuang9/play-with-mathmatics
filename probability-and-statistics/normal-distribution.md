## Where is normal distribution coming from

We know we can conlcude the normal distribution from the limits of binominal distribution.

But it is Gaussian that gets the normal distribution.

Gaussian researches the bias of measurement, and get the measurement bias is normal distribution, which actually is equivalent to Central Limits Theorem. 

## Why normal distribution is important.

It is because the central limit theorem,  central limit theorem guranttees the mean value from sample is normal distribution. So we can do statiscal inference on the mean value based on the normal distribution. Two fomous inferences are interval confidence and hypothesis test, which are based on normal distribution.
