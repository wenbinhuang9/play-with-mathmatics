## What is hypothesis test ?

If we have a statement that is the mean of population bigger than 10 ? We may use hypothesis test. Hypothesis is useful to reject such a statement, if hypothesis can not reject the statement, we may think the statement is plausible, but we can't conclude that the staement is true. 

## How I understand the hypothesis test? 

I think hopythesis is very similar to contradiction proof in logic. But it is a kind of probabilistic contradiction proof, which means our proof may be true or false in some probability. 

Another principle of hypothesis that the event with samll probability can't occur. So if such a rare event occurs, we can reject the statement.  

## Null Hypothesis, and Alternate Hypothesis

We use H0 to denote null hypothesis; we use HA to denote alternate hypothesis. 

## How to test the hypothesis.


We are given the significance level, if the p-value (what is p-value)
