Relation algebra is theretically used to the realtion query operations. It is the fundamental theorem to sql query. 

I think relation algebra is very nice, at first, we can define operations to make the query felxible ,actually the necessary operations are only  small part, but these operations can satisfy all kinds of sql query. What an amazing.

And relation algebra is closed under its operations, which means relation algebra uses relation as a basic unit for operations, that is relation algebra accepts realtion as input and also ouput relation. It is beautiful, just like arithmetic, it is basic element is number, and input is number , output is also number.

### Relation And operations
Relation refers to table in relational database.

Basic operations

- Selection 
- Projection
- Cartesian Product

These are three basic operations, and it can satisfy all kinds of sql query.
