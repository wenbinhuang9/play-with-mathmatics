## What is relational data model.

Relation is nothong more than a table.  Relational database is row oriented. The row can also be called the tuple. And the tuple is composed by the n number of attributes. Each attribute can also be called column.


Actually, relational model is very intuitive and simple, and easy to understand.   

From mathmatical perspective, I think relation model is nothing more than a set. Each table is a set, and we can define operations on the one set or more than two sets.

## Key

As we can understand relational database as a set, each element in the set is distinct. So in the relational model, it is also required each row to be distinct. So we have the primary key for the table.

The primary key is a set of attributes, which can be used to make each row distinct.

## Relational operations

As we need to do some queries on the data, so we need to define some operations on the data. Actually, the famous mysql is based onthe relaional operations. So how many operations we can deine to satisfy different query requirements. 

1. Selection 
2. Projection
3. Decart production
4. Join
5.
