Actually, when we write a table, we need to consider where to get the data.  so we should firstly  consider the from clause.  

- we can get data from a single table
- we can also get data from two table, such as from table1, table2. We may even use more than 2 tables. 
- we can also get data by join (or left joi), such as from  A join B on(A.ID = B.ID). We may even use more than 3 joins. 
- we can also get data from a virtual table by subquery ( this can usually be used to problem about aggregation)
