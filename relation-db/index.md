## Why index

Index is used to fasten query for performance improvement. Index is just like bookmark, which fastern query the specified page and content. 

## How many kinds of index

There are majorly two kinds of index, sequential sorted index and hash index.

Sequential sorted index can be implemented by tree structure, which support sorting. While hash index is very similar to hashtable, which is based on hash data structure


As for the other classification, there are sparse index and dense index.  Each search key will be shown in the index. While for the sparse index, only part of keys are shown in the index. 

There is a trade-off between space-efficiency and query performance for sparse index and dense index.
